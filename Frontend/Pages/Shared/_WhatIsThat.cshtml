                    This is the front end of an advanced machine learning system
                    designed to predict future safety levels across countries for
                    different demographic groups. The project employs an LSTM 
                    algorithm alongside global crime statistics to forecast crime
                    trends accurately. By analyzing patterns over time, the system
                    estimates future security levels for each country, providing users
                    with insights into global safety conditions. Whether you're looking
                    into personal safety forecasts or broader trends, this platform 
                    offers a powerful, data-driven perspective on the future of global
                    security.
